<p> The history behind homeslessness in America is a long one. With reports dating back to as early as the 1870s, the topic at hand isn't widely unheard of or a fairly new problem due to the growing numbers related to affordable housing available. However, being a newer person to New York City, it shocked me to see just how much disregard many homeless people are shown. A man could be asleep in Times Square, his clothes battered, and people in much nicer clothes walk around him as if he is trash on the street. As if he does not exist. With that, I was curious to know what are New Yorkers or organizations doing to help? </p>


<h4> Here are ways people find themselves without a place to go, some statistical factors that add to it, and some programs that have been put in place to help alleviate the issue: </h4>

<h2> 1. Homelessness isn't picky. </h2>

  <p> Many people believe they are greatly removed from ever becoming homeless themselves. However, the number of ways that a person ends up homeless varies greatly.   <a href="https://endhomelessness.org/homelessness-in-america/what-causes-homelessness/" target="_blank" title="What Causes Homelessness">According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, </a>  here are just a few different ways:
    <ul>
  <li> Housing Affordability</li>
  <li> Health</li>
  <li> Income</li>
<li> Domestic Violence  </li>
<li> Racial Disparities (e.g., poverty, housing discrimination) </li>
  </ul>

<h2> 2. Who is mostly impacted? </h2>

<div>
    <p> When some people hear the word "homeless," what usually pops into mind is an image of an unkept person laying on the sidewalk. However a compelling truth in the matter is that homelessness affects everyone! About 30% of people experiencing homelessness are under the age of 24, according to a 2018 report conducted by the Department of Housing and Urban Development's</p>

    <p> This can significantly affect the mental, emotional, and social development of these young people. Which can possibly lead to having long-lasting effects on their confidence and overall stability.

    <p> In addition, mostly individuals from minority groups make up a great chunk of the homeless popluation. The effects of slavery and systemic racism still linger today, showing itself greatly in the homeless epidemic. Between segregation separating races from living together and housing discrimination which wouldn't allow certain racial groups to live in areas they weren't "welcomed" in -- this left many households of color living in poverty strucken areas. Add in the lack of opportunities to receive house mortgages and business loans, and you create a cycle where it is very easy to fall into homelessness. </p>

<h2> 3. How big of a role do drugs play? </h2>

    </div>

      <div>
        <p> The history and connection between homelessness and substance abuse runs deep. Addictive substance abuse disorders can oftentimes cause a person to prioritize drugs over paying bills or securing food. Placing both them and their family in unfortunate predicaments. </p>

        <p> However is most cases, substance abuse isn't the cause for homelessness at all. It can very much be side effect, acting as an escape from the harsh reality that exists ahead. </p>

<h2> 4. What is being done to help. </h2>

<div>
  <p> The most obvious solution to ending homelessness is by getting members of that community housed. Preferably somewhere safe and secure so that they remain housed. There are a couple different initiatives that help with that. The one most people are familiar with is "Section 8 Housing." It's basically a federal housing voucher program that assists low-income household with firstly finding a place and then helping them pay for the bills. Without the burden of bills piling up, it helps alleviate some stress of the individuals. Other alternatives include public housing or short-term rental assistance, which helps house homeless people as quickly as possible.  </p>

    <div class="container">
<p> At the end of all of us, I just want to advocate that we as a society show a little more grace towards eachother. Just because someone's living situation isn't the most ideal, or is nonexistent, doesn't make them any lesser than of a person. Ask instead what you can do to help and remember that it can easily happen to you or someone you love. This unfortunate situation shouldn't justify or at all translate to the "end all be all" of basic humanity. </p>
